        <p>Community involvement is something that we are big supporters of here at Torgerson Design Partners. Whether it be through volunteering, donating to organizations we support, or involvement in community clubs, we strive to be leaders in supporting the communities that we live in. Many people have a desire to get involved in their community, but often times they don’t know what organization to join or how to go about getting involved. To give you a few ideas, we’ve put together this list of some of the organizations that we support as a company, and that members of our team are a part of. There are <em>so many</em> options, and you may have to do a little research of your own to find something that’s right for you, but hopefully, these will inspire you to take the leap to get involved!</p>

Rotary is an organization of business and professional leaders united worldwide who provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. Rotary’s main objective is service to the community, the workplace, and the world. They focus on developing community service projects that address critical issues such as children at risk, poverty and hunger, the environment, illiteracy, and violence.</p><p>The first Rotary Club began in Chicago in 1905 by an attorney who wanted professionals of diverse backgrounds to be able to exchange ideas, make friends, and work on improving their community. The club got its name because, in its earliest days, members would rotate their meetings among each member's office. Today, there are Rotary Clubs on 6 continents!</p><p>A few of the Ozark Rotary Club’s most recent events include<strong> helping Care to Learn Ozark pack backpacks</strong> with items that students might need during Spring break, <strong>a basketball tournament to support the Special Olympics</strong>, and a <strong>tree planting day</strong> to help out the environment!</p><p>For more information on joining Ozark Rotary Club, click <a href="https://ozarkrotary.webs.com/">here</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>7. Historic River District/Main Street Initiative</strong></p><p>Abbye Torgerson, another member of the TDP team, is a member of the Historic River District / Main Street Initiative organization, which is working to catalyze revitalization in the downtown Ozark area. Last fall, Ozark received a grant to help fund the revitalization of downtown Ozark. The grant, which totals $24,000 is being covered by the city of Ozark (40%,) and Missouri Main Street (60%.) The organization is hoping to use the money for the central business district, and to expand the improvements to the area around the square. A few of their goals are to expand Ozark’s sidewalks off of the square, as well as repairing some of the existing sidewalks. They also hope to carry the historic appearance of the square to the structures in the surrounding area and along 3rd street.</p><p>There are four committees that members can be a part of: <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>Economic Vitality</strong>, <strong>Organization,</strong> and <strong>Promotion</strong>. For more information, or if you are interested in joining one of these committees, you can contact organization president, Brad Jackson, or secretary Megan Morris at <a href="mailto:historicriverdistrict@gmail.com">historicriverdistrict@gmail.com</a>. The Historic River District organization would love to have more team members help to plan and promote community events, make our downtown area more beautiful, and help local businesses succeed.</p>

              <p><strong>8. Mentorship Programs </strong></p><p>TDP team member Cody Hearne is a part of the AIAS / HSA Mentorship program with Drury University. This is a program where local professionals in the field of architecture are paired up with Drury architecture students to give them a bit of an inside look at what they will be doing in their career after graduation. The mentors meet with the mentees and <strong>assist them with their designs by giving desk critiques and outside feed back, sitting in on reviews, and providing them with other opportunities related to our field of work.</strong> They also answer questions the students may have about what to expect after graduation. The main goal of the program is to to bridge the divide between students and professionals so that they are prepared for work once they finish school.</p><p>While this program is specifically for architects, there are a variety of other mentorship programs in our area that you could get involved in. The Mission to Mentor program through the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Springfield is a great option if you want to be a fun, positive influence in a child’s life. The Boys &amp; Girls Club’s main mission is to guide youth, especially those from at-risk environments, in the right direction through social, physical, and educational developmental activities. They feel that giving these youth a one-on-one mentor is a great way to help them stay on the right track.</p><p>Another similar organization is Big Brothers Big Sisters. Here, “bigs” (or mentors,) are matched with “littles” (mentees) based on personality types, interests, main need of the mentee, etc. Involvement in this program can be as simple as having lunch with your little once a week, or if you’d prefer to be a bit more involved, you can sign up to be a community based big, where you do some sort of activity with your little each week.</p><p>If you are interested in getting involved with either the <a href="https://www.bgclubspringfield.org/mission/">Boys &amp; Girls Club</a> or Big Brothers Big Sisters (www.bigbro.com,) head over to their websites to find out more information and to apply!</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p>
