Torgerson Design Partners’ web server will recognize your domain name, which will be collected to monitor the general use of the Site and for improvements to the Site, our products, and services. Similarly, cookies provide non-personal information which allows us to track the anonymous use of our Site, including use and traffic statistics each time you visit by placing small data files placed on your hard drive by the Site.

Further detail on cookies is discussed below. You can disable or reject the use of cookies, by modifying the appropriate settings on your browser. Note that by doing so, however, you will likely not enjoy the full functionality of the Site.</p><h3>Use, Disclosure and Protection of Personal Information</h3><p>It is Torgerson Design Partners' intention to obtain Personal Information only by fair and lawful means and to use the Personal Information to service your needs and requests. Torgerson Design Partners will not process Personal Information in a manner incompatible with the purposes for which it was originally collected unless later authorized by the individual from whom the information was collected or unless allowed by law. We will not keep Personal Information longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was originally gathered.</p><p>When do collect and process Personal Information about individuals, we will disclose certain information to those particular individuals on a reasonable and timely basis upon written request of the individuals from whom the Personal Information was collected. The disclosed information will include what Personal Information is being collected, who is collecting it, how and for what purposes it is being collected, how it is being us and to whom it is being disclosed. We will allow individuals reasonable access to their Personal Information to verify, correct or delete their data, where inaccurate.</p><p>We may also use Personal Information to process an order made through the Site, including shipping and returns of such order, and for organizing and submitting customer satisfaction reviews. We may also use such Personal Information to support marketing for our products and services and to enhance the content and use of our Site.</p><p>In order for Torgerson Design Partners to provide our products and services, we may need to share your Personal Information with other companies, agencies or contractors affiliated with Torgerson Design Partners. We will always seek to ensure that it is kept secure and only used in accordance with your instructions and agreed purpose.</p><p>Further, we may use and disclose Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with laws, regulations, court orders, government agencies or investigations and similar legal instructions, to resolve disputes, and to protect Torgerson Design Partners rights and property.</p><p>Additionally, we may also contract with other third parties to provide services, such as shipping, payment processing, contact verification, market research, and organization of promotions, or other subcontractors; however, we will provide these contractual parties only with the Personal Information necessary to perform the work for which they were contracted. </p><p>Torgerson Design Partners and its third-party providers may use cloud-based tools, and in such an event, data might be processed in countries outside the United States.

By visiting this web site you are agreeing to our use of cookies for these purposes. For example, services like Google Analytics collect information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.

Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages are visited, and what other sites are used prior to coming to the Site. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google®.

These mechanisms will normally be available on the relevant email or web site, but you may always notify us at the address specified below under “Contact Us”. Requests to opt-out of communications based on data controlled by third parties must be made through a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there may be some jurisdictions requiring stricter opt-in versus opt-out mechanisms relating to these types of communications and we will comply with the applicable laws in such locations.</p><h3>External Links; Public Social Media</h3><p>This Site may provide links to other third party websites, including social media sites. These links are provided to you for your convenience only, and you access them at your own risk. Even if the third party is affiliated with Torgerson Design Partners, if you choose to use these links, Torgerson Design Partners is not responsible for the conditions or results of use, privacy policies or practices, or the content of such external links or the person or entity responsible for them. You should review the applicable terms of use and privacy policy provisions of such third party websites before using them.</p><p>Furthermore, any information you submit in a public forum or social marketing site that is publicly available (such as a chat room, public posting or blog, whether or not sponsored by Torgerson Design Partners) can be read, collected, or used by us as well as others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit through these media, and although we attempt to monitor user-posted content, such user-posted material is not subject to this privacy statement. Use of any Torgerson Design Partners-related social media or marketing site may also be subject to additional policies and terms of use, which you should review before posting any such public information.</p><h3>Other Torgerson Design Partners Sites</h3><p>This Privacy Policy is applicable to this Site, as specified above.
